## Installation

Install via NPM

```shell
npm install react-mp3-player
```

or use yarn

```shell
yarn add react-mp3-player
```

## Usage

Import the Playlist component

```Javascript
import Playlist from 'react-mp3-player';
```

The tracks format will be ann array of objects, each object containing a name, description, src mp3 and an optional image.
There's also an optional `autoStopAt` property for a track, which is represented by an array of numbers (seconds from the start - can be floating-point values or integers) where the track should automatically pause.

```Javascript
const tracks = [{ img: 'https://icon-library.net/images/music-icon-transparent/music-icon-transparent-11.jpg', name:'MP3', desc: 'Description 1', src:'Audio.mp3'},
{ img: 'https://icon-library.net/images/music-icon-transparent/music-icon-transparent-11.jpg', name:'MP3 #2', desc: 'Description 2', src:'Audio2.mp3'}]
```

Additional properties can be added to the component such as a right or left offset to decrease the width of the player as well as being able to choose the breakpoint for switching to mobile view, these options are passed into the playlist component in an object as props.

```Javascript
const playlistOverideStylingOpts = {
  offset : {
    left : 300
  },
  breakpoint : {
    maxWidth : 768
    }
};
```

Add the Player component and pass it the relative mp3 tracks as well as any addition style options as opts

```Javascript
<Playlist tracks={tracks} opts={playlistOverideStylingOpts}/>
```
